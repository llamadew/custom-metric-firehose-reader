This is a simple Spring Boot based app to demonstrate using https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client[CF-Java-Client] to listen to Cloudfoundry Firehose events


== Demonstration
* Set these environment variables:

FIREHOSE_HOST
FIREHOSE_USER
FIREHOSE_PASSWORD

* Start the application
[source]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----

* If everything is configured cleanly, you should can start collecting metric by requesting:
[source]
----
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/apps/{Application GUID}/metric_settings/{Metric Name}"
----

After appoximately 30 seconds you can see aggregated metrics by hitting the following metrics endpoints:

[source]
----
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/apps/{Application GUID}/metrics/{Metric Name}"
----

[source]
----
 curl  "http://localhost:8080/apps/{Application GUID}/last_metric/{Metric Name}"
----


You can append a query param to any of the metrics enpoints to get only the specific aggregation you are interested in:

Aggregation options are:

.Table Title
|===
|Aggregation Name

|average

|min

|max

|sum
|===

For example:

[source]
----
curl  "http://localhost:8080/apps/{Application GUID}/last_metric/{Metric Name}?aggregation=average"
----

* To Stop monitoring for a specific app metric:
[source]
----
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/apps/{Application GUID}/metric_settings/{Metric Name}"
